<h1>Something</h1>

<h1>Arequipa </h1> 
<h2>Ben Okri </h2>


<p>
Leaves that fall.<br>
Ought to breathe<br>
Fire from stone.<br>
The world counts<br>
On our fall.<br>
Our solitude interests<br> 
The butterflies<br> 
And the lost gold<br>
Of the afternoons.
</p>
<p>
Orche and blue walls<br>
And the fading peaks<br>
Of volcanoes<br>
And the sunlight<br>
Plummeting beyond<br>
The hills waken<br>
Leaves to their<br>
Lost trees.
</p>
<p>
To discover<br>
You still have<br>
A world<br>
To make<br>
At sunset<br>
Sobers<br>
The stones
