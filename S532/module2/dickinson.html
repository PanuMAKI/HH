<p>
Leaves that fall.<br>
Ought to breathe<br>
Fire from stone<br>
The world counts.<br>
On our fall.<br>
Our solitude interests<br> 
The butterflies<br> 
And the lost gold<br>
Of the afternoons
</p>
<p>
The eyes beside had wrung them dry,<br>
And breaths were gathering sure<br>
For that last onset, when the King<br>
Be witnessed in his power.
</p>
<p>
I willed my keepsakes, signed away<br>
What portion of me I<br>
Could make assignable &#8212; and then<br>
There interposed a fly,
</p>
<p>
With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz<br>
Between the light and me;<br>
And then the windows failed &#8212; and then<br>
I could not see to see.
